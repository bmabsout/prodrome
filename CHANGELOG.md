# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for its
API. THE STORED BYTES ARE A SEPARATE PROMISE and a stricter one: a shipped
constructor's fields never change, in any release.

## [Unreleased]

The Prodrome in the browser, a read-only viewer of this crate's roadmap
folded and typeset on the reader's machine, and GitHub issues mirrored onto
that roadmap. Typst and GitHub enter the repository only as optional extras
beside the core; `core/` and `cli/` depend on neither, and no stored byte
changes.

And `Absent`, the empty term (`docs/design-empty-term.md`): an object with no
claim on attention is priced by a term whose value is `∅`, so FPL is total
and an unpriced todo stops being a special case in every reader. A MINOR
change under this file's rule: no stored object changes, a term without
`Absent` reads exactly what it read, and the API breaks where a value was an
`f64`.

And the object store is durable and its fsck honest, which are PATCH fixes
under this file's rule: no stored byte changes, and a healthy store reads and
verifies exactly as it did.

And change identity (`docs/design-change-identity.md`, SPEC §3): a change is
named by its prodrome, its event and the writes it supersedes, never by
where it was written, so appending is idempotent, changes to different todos
are independent, and a conflict prices as its most urgent candidate. A MINOR
change under this file's rule: `Genesis`, `Change`, `Snapshot` and `Least`
are new constructors and no stored object changes; a legacy store derives,
linearises and verifies as it did, and reads as it did wherever no register
holds two candidates. The API breaks where a register had a winner.

And register types, stage 1 (`docs/design-register-types.md`): a register's
values are partially ordered and its reading is their maximal values. A
MINOR change under this file's rule: the todo's registers are discrete, so
every reading and every stored byte is as it was.

And register types, stage 2: a store is opened at a SCHEMA, the type of its
events, and the store, the fold, `verify` and the view are generic over one;
the todo schema is the reference one. A MINOR change under this file's rule:
no stored byte and no object name moves, and every vector reads as it did.
The API breaks wherever a type was parameterised by the payload.

And register types, stage 3: prodrome-wasm's exports are generic over a
schema, and a host builds ONE module of all its schemas with a macro, from a new
library crate. A
MINOR change under this file's rule: no stored byte moves, and every export
the reference module had answers byte for byte as it did.

And a schema's price is what the design says a valuation is: `Price`, the
term each candidate of a reading prices as, the reading priced as `Least`
over them. What the todo alone has, a price that changes with its history,
what a `Ref` reads of an entity, and what a list row shows, are `History`,
`Bind` and `Row`, each implemented only by a schema that has it. Unreleased
API only: `schema::Valuation` and the wasm's `PricedJson` never shipped in a
release, and every vector and export reads byte for byte as it did.

And a store remembers what it has read (`docs/design-register-types.md`
§6.1, stage 7's in-memory replica): a handle verifies each object once and
holds it with the fold of them all, so an append and a read cost the objects
new since it last looked and not the store. At 3,500 objects (17.6 MB) a
warm append falls from about 235 ms to about 15 ms and a warm read from
about 120 ms to about 8 ms (`core/examples/store_cost.rs`). A MINOR change
under this file's rule: no stored byte moves, every vector reads as it did,
and a store read through its memory reads exactly as one read cold. The API
breaks where `dag()` answered a copy.

And replicas (`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.1, stage 7): a store on
disk, a store in memory and an overlay are one `Replica`, `sync` is the
join of any two, and a coordinated decision is a type only the store on
disk has. A MINOR change under this file's rule: no stored byte moves,
every vector and export reads as it did, and the reference module's
classes gain a method.

And a change rests on what its writer saw (SPEC §3, laws 36 and 37): its
deps are its entity's heads, every write to it in any register that no
other descends from, where they were the frontiers of the registers it
writes. One writer's add and complete of one entity are no longer recorded
as concurrent, so the stream orders them as written and no instant has to.
A MINOR change under this file's rule: no shipped field changes and no
stored object moves or reads differently; an append over a history writes
a different object than before wherever its entity has a head outside the
registers it writes. A reader before this one reports such a dep as
writing no register its change writes.

And caches (`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.2, stage 8): a cache is a
tabulation of a pure function, a store of (key, value) pairs joined by
union, and hierarchical caching is one memoised fold over a
content-addressed tree of any shape. A MINOR change under this file's
rule: a new module, and no stored byte, vector or export moves.

And nesting (`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.3, stage 9, SPEC law 39):
a register may hold a history by its heads, a nest of such histories
flattens into one history keyed by path, renaming no object, and every way
one replica takes chosen objects from another is one restricted join. A
MINOR change under this file's rule: new API only, no stored byte moves,
the object model gains no constructor, and every vector and export reads
as it did.

And time's one type (`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.2): a behaviour
that is piecewise constant is a `Schedule<A>`, a step function with its
algebra law-tested, and what reimplemented one (a `Piecewise`'s pieces, a
register's history, the wire's environment over time, an observed value)
is one or a function of one, with one fold over time where there were two.
A MINOR change under this file's rule: no stored byte, vector or export
answer moves; the API breaks where a `Piecewise` layer had two fields.

### Added

- **Schedules (design §6.2):** `schedule::Schedule<A>`, a head and knots at
  strictly increasing instants, meaning the function whose value at `t` is
  the last knot at or before `t` (`at`, `since`, `last`). `new` refuses
  knots out of order (`schedule::Unordered`) and `of` builds one from a
  map. `map` and `traverse`, `zip` and `sequence` with `constant`, `+` and
  `Sum` where the value is a monoid, `join` for a schedule of schedules,
  `shift`, `normal` and `next_change`. `fold::readings`, an entity's
  registers as a schedule, of which `fold::read` is the value at an
  instant. `observe::observed`, the observed value of an exact term from an
  instant on, as a schedule. Laws in `core/tests/all/schedule.rs`,
  `fold_laws.rs` (a reading at a moment is the readings at it) and
  `observe.rs` (the observed schedule is the observed value).
And device signatures (`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.4, stage 12,
SPEC §3, §5 and law 42): who wrote an object can be proven. A signature is
an object of its own naming what it signs, so no object's bytes or name
change and an object gains signatures at any time; a key belongs to an
actor because an object says so; and a policy may require the proof. A
MINOR change under this file's rule: `Signed`, `KeyAdded` and `KeyRevoked`
are new constructors, no stored object changes, and a history whose actors
have no keys reads, verifies and exports exactly as it did under every
policy that does not require signatures. The API breaks where a policy
answered about an event: it answers about an object.

### Added

- **Signatures and keys as objects (SPEC §3):** `sign`. `Signed(object,
  key, signature)`, Ed25519 (`ed25519-dalek`, strict verification) over
  `prodrome object ` and the object's name, its one parent the object it
  signs; `KeyAdded(genesis, actor, key)`, with no parents;
  `KeyRevoked(genesis, deps, actor, key)`, keeping the signatures beneath
  its deps. `sign::Secret`, a device key from the seed its host keeps,
  signing deterministically; `sign::PublicKey`, `sign::Signature`.
- **The proof (SPEC §5, law 42):** `sign::Proof::of(dag, registrar)`, the
  objects a key registered to their actor signed, beneath every revocation
  of it, a function of the object set; `sign::Registrar::Anyone` (every
  key object, as `verify` reads them) or `Roots`.
- **The policy that requires signatures (SPEC §5):** `policy::Proven<P>`,
  the meet of any policy and the proof, its keys registered by root keys,
  made at a history (`Proven::new(policy, roots, history)`) and read at
  another by `Policy::at`; `Standing::and`. An unproven object claims, a content record included.
- **`verify` reports** a `Signed` that does not verify
  (`Finding::Forged`) and an object whose actor has a key and which no key
  of that actor's proves (`Finding::Unsigned`).
- **The wasm exports:** every schema's class gains `sign(secret, object)`,
  sealing a held object's signature into the page's replica and answering
  `{hash, objects}` as `append` does; `proven(roots)`; and the static
  `public_key(secret)`. Every reading's policy argument also takes
  `{untrusted, roots}`; an array of actor names reads as it did.

### Changed (breaking)

- **A policy answers about an object:** `Policy::standing(object, event)`
  and `Policy::confirms(object, event)` take the object's name, and a
  policy is asked of every object carrying an event, where the readers
  asked only of events the schema `asks` about. `Untrusted` and
  `Everything` answer exactly as they did; a host's own policy binds what
  the schema does not ask about by checking `asks` itself, as `Untrusted`
  does. `Policy::at(history)`, the policy at a history (`None` for one
  that reads nothing of a history), which the store's `verify` asks.
- **`dag::Finding`** gains `Forged` and `Unsigned`.

And a schema as data (`docs/design-register-types.md` §5 and §6.0, stage
10, SPEC law 40): a schema may arrive as text at run time, is admitted only
when its laws hold, and is read by the code a Rust schema is read by. A
MINOR change under this file's rule: no stored byte moves, the object model
gains no constructor, no object carries its schema, and every vector and
export reads as it did. The API breaks where a schema's vocabulary was a
type with a `Default`: it is now a value a store is opened at.

And a set of prodromes is a prodrome (`docs/design-register-types.md`
§6.3.1, SPEC §7.2 and law 41): a qualified reference, `RefIn(store,
entity)`, prices a term in one store by an entity in another, through a set
of prodromes the host passes. A MINOR change under this file's rule: `RefIn`
is a new term constructor, so no stored byte moves, and every unqualified
`Ref` links and reads as it did. The API breaks where `TermF::Ref` had one
field.

### Added

- **A qualified reference (SPEC §7.2):** `fpl::mk_ref_in` and the term
  `RefIn(store, entity)`, the same variable as `Ref` with a qualifier:
  `TermF::Ref { store, entity }`, `store` none for an unqualified one, which
  prints as `Ref(todo)` did. `fpl::Stores`, a set of prodromes as qualified
  references read it (`fpl::Member`, each member's functions and
  environment, by genesis, and `Stores::named` for a host's names), and
  `fpl::link_in`, of which `link` is the case with no stores. A qualified
  reference is linked in its member and compiled against that member's
  environment, so it reads what its entity reads at home; a store or an
  entity the set lacks reads `∅`. Its JSON kind is `refIn`. Laws in
  `core/tests/all/sets.rs`.
- **A set of prodromes (design §6.3.1, SPEC law 41):** `nest::Set`, a
  replica's prodromes as a nest keyed by genesis, each read by a member
  level, whose join puts every object at `genesis/key`; `Dag::genesis_of`,
  the genesis of an object's prodrome. `fold::member`, one prodrome as a
  term elsewhere reads it, and `fold::stores`, a fold's prodromes as an
  `fpl::Stores`; `view::entries` prices through `fold::member`, and links
  each entry through the set of its DAG's prodromes, so a qualified
  reference to a sibling prodrome prices as that prodrome's view does. Laws in
  `core/tests/all/sets.rs`: disjointness, a set of sets is associative, and
  the set's reading is the product of its members'.
- **The inbox, priced by what it serves (design §0, §6.3.1):** a test
  schema, `core/tests/schemas/inbox.rs`, whose proposal's `Price` is a
  qualified reference to the todo it serves; read through a set of it and
  two todo prodromes, its price is that todo's and moves exactly when that
  todo's history does (`sets.rs`).

- **A schema as data (design §5, §6.0, stage 10, SPEC law 40):** `declared`.
  `declared::Form`, a schema in the schema language, the objects' own §2
  literal grammar under a closed vocabulary: event constructors with typed
  fields (text, integer, instant, reference, a closed enum, a list), the
  key, and registers with an order (`Discrete`, `Total`, a `Machine` given
  by its covering relation, `Inclusion`), inflationary or not, and the
  fields that write them; `print` is canonical, every set sorted.
  `declared::Declaration::admit(text)`, the only way to a declaration,
  asks eight laws in order and refuses with the first that fails
  (`declared::Law`, `declared::Refusal`): grammar, canonical (the text is
  its own print, so its name is its hash), unique names, the key, a stamp
  on every event, typed routes, every order a partial order (a machine's
  covers acyclic) and a bottom under every inflationary register.
  `declared::Declared`, an event of a declared schema, implements `Schema`
  with the declaration as its vocabulary; its registers are `Frontier`s
  read under the declared order (`declared::Valued`, the core's own
  orders interpreted) and an inflationary one climbs by `fold::grows`.
  Laws in `core/tests/all/declared.rs`: a differential against the
  proposal schema written in Rust (`core/tests/schemas/proposal.rs`) over
  generated histories and through stores, law 1 and law 2 over the
  declared schema, a lawful generated schema admitted and a broken one
  refused under the law it breaks; `nest_histories.rs` nests it.
- **`EventStore::at`, `MemoryStore::at`, `Replica::schema`:** a store
  opened at a schema value; an overlay parses at its base's.
- **`literal::Signature::Owned`:** a field order a vocabulary holds as
  owned names, bound by the function that binds a static one.
- **The wasm exports over a declared schema:** `schema!(Name, declared)`, a
  class `new Name(schema, objects)` that admits the schema first, with
  `declaration()`; the reference module exports it as `Declared`.

- **Nesting (design §6.3, stage 9, SPEC law 39):** `nest`. `nest::Path`,
  the free monoid on `nest::Segment`s, and `nest::History<T>`, a set of
  `(path, value)` pairs that is a monad (`unit`, `fmap`, `join`, `bind`),
  read at a path by `at` and joined with chosen values of an inner history
  by `accept`. `nest::Heads<I>`, a register value holding a history of the
  schema `I` by its heads, ordered by inclusion; `nest::Nests`, a schema's
  held registers; `nest::pointer`, a held register's reading, the union of
  its maximal writes' heads. `nest::Nest`, a tree of content-addressed
  histories read from each level's replica by `nest::Leaf` and
  `nest::Holding`: `flatten` (the join), `below` and `past` (happens-before
  across levels), and a `memo::Tree`, so `memo::fold` folds it.
  `store::accept(from, to, chosen)`, the restricted join for replicas;
  `sync`, `EventStore::adopt` and `Overlay::flush` are it, and
  `Overlay::accept` takes a batch object by object. Laws in
  `core/tests/all/nest.rs`, `nest_histories.rs` and `replica.rs`.
- **Caches (design §6.2, stage 8, law 8):** `memo`, depending on the hash
  type alone. `memo::Cache`, pairs keyed by `memo::Key` (a function's
  name and its argument's), each key a register in the flat order:
  `get` answers a miss, a hit or a `Finding` (two values, held and never
  chosen), `insert` and `join` (union) answer the findings they make,
  and any entry may be removed. `memo::Evict` decides what is dropped;
  `Keep` and a bounded `Lru` ship. `memo::fold`, the memoised
  catamorphism over any `memo::Tree` (a content name and children) by any
  `memo::Algebra` (a name and a step), memoised at every node by
  (algebra, node) and answering a `memo::Report`: per node and by depth,
  what hit, what was computed and which keys held two values.
  `memo::name`, the Merkle name a node must have, covering its children's.
  `memo::balance`, a long sequence as a balanced tree of the host's own
  measured chunks, its shape a function of the elements alone. Laws in
  `core/tests/all/memo.rs`, `memo_fold.rs` and `memo_balance.rs`.
And a behaviour names its next observed change
(`docs/design-register-types.md` §6.2, SPEC §7 and law 38): a view reads a
fulfillment through an `Observation`, and `next_change` answers when what it
shows next changes, exactly on the exact fragment and never late elsewhere.
A MINOR change under this file's rule: new API only, no stored byte moves,
and every vector and export reads as it did.

### Added

- **The next observed change (design §6.2, SPEC §7 and law 38):**
  `observe::Observation`, a quantisation of `[0, 1] ∪ {∅}` (`levels` equal
  steps, `Rounding::{Down, Nearest, Up}`, `Observation::PERCENT`), and
  `observe::next_change(term, now, env, observation)`, answering
  `NextChange { at, exact }`: the first microsecond after `now` at which the
  observed value differs, `None` for never. Exact on the exact fragment,
  each atom's closed form cutting time into affine stretches bisected
  against the evaluator; conservative elsewhere, by an enclosure of the term
  over `[now, t]`, never later than the true change. The wasm exports carry
  it: `next_change(term, now, env, observation)` in the reference module,
  and `next_changes(at, untrusted, observation)` per row on a priced
  schema's class, an observation crossing as `{levels, rounding}`.

- **Replicas (design §6.1, stage 7, SPEC §3 and law 35):** `store::Replica`,
  what every store is: `held` (its objects, fold and tips of one look),
  `tips`, `print`, `append` and `receive`, which takes in what some seeds
  rest on, every object verified before any is taken, parents first.
  `store::sync(from, to)`, one function over any two. `store::MemoryStore`,
  a store in memory that appends by the decision an `EventStore` makes
  (`Memory::change`), byte for byte. `store::Overlay`, which writes to
  memory, reads `own ∪ base` from the base's memory with its own objects
  admitted over it, and is flushed by `sync`. `store::Decision`, from
  `EventStore::decide`: the lock held and the memory level with the
  directory, reads as of the lock and an append written through; an
  overlay and a store in memory have none (compile-fail doctests). A
  borrowed replica is a replica.
- **The wasm exports append:** each schema's class has `append(event,
  genesis)`, sealing an event's print into the page's replica as a `Change`
  over its own fold and answering `{hash, objects}`, the objects
  (`[{hash, text}]`) to send the host, none for a twin.
- **A store's memory (design §6.1, stage 7):** `EventStore` holds every
  object it has read, each verified once (rehashed from its file, or sealed
  by its own append), their tips and their fold. A read or an append lists
  `objects/` and reads only the names the memory lacks; a held file is read
  again only when its `stat` no longer matches what was seen when it was
  verified (or it changed too recently for `stat` to tell, git's racily
  clean), and `verify` still rehashes everything. An append decides its
  twin check and its deps on the memory under the store's lock, after the
  look that brings the memory level with the directory, so another
  writer's objects are always in it. `EventStore::folded` answers the fold
  (`fold(&dag.nodes_across_gaps()?)`), kept by insertion. Laws, in
  `core/tests/all/memory.rs`: any interleaving of appends by this handle,
  another and a fresh one, a third replica's files arriving in no causal
  order, deletions and reads reads as a fresh handle does (objects, fold,
  readings, heads); every append writes the bytes a fresh handle's would;
  and an adoption through the memory is idempotent, order-free, completes
  when interrupted, and reads as the union of the two directories.
- **`Folded::insert`:** an object placed where the linearisation of the
  union puts it, so the fold is an action of the object SET: in any
  parents-first order, inserting is `fold` of the whole. It holds where
  every object rests only on objects of its own scope (`Folded::local`,
  true of every store an append wrote); elsewhere it answers
  `registers::Elsewhere` and changes nothing. `Folded::push` is the monoid
  action's step `extend` was made of, and `BitSet::open` makes room for a
  position.
- `core/examples/store_cost.rs`: an append and a read, cold and warm,
  against a store of a host's size.

- **`prodrome-wasm-exports`, the exports generic over a schema** (a new
  library crate, `wasm/exports/`): `Replica` reads a set of objects once at
  a schema, and `verify`, `tips` (each prodrome's heads by its genesis),
  `since` (what a replica holding some tips lacks), `readings` (each
  register's maximal writes, for any schema), and, for a schema with a
  `Row`, a `History` and a `Bind`, `entries` and `prices` answer over it.
  `Json` is what a schema says to cross the boundary (the field its events
  name an entity by, its registers' names, its values' JSON) and `RowJson`
  its row's reading's JSON; the todo schema has both, at any payload.
  `prodrome_wasm_exports::schema!(Name = Schema)`, with `, priced` for a
  schema with those three, instantiates them as a JS class per schema in one
  module. The
  term codec (`json`) and the wire shapes (`wire`) moved into it.
  prodrome-wasm, the reference module, instantiates `Todos` with it, beside
  its exports, which answer as they did.
- **`fold::Product::reading(register)`:** a register's reading by name, its
  frontier's maximal writes under its type's order, so a reader holding
  only `Schema::REGISTERS` reads any schema. SPEC law 33's test compares it
  too. The tests' review schema is `core/tests/schemas/review.rs`, which
  prodrome-wasm's tests instantiate through `schema!` over a small store.

- **`schema::Schema` (SPEC §4, §6, §8):** what a store's events are and what
  each writes: the vocabulary (`Vocabulary`, `to_value`, `from_value`), the
  `key`, `at` and `actor` of an event, the registers it supersedes in
  (`Register`, `REGISTERS`, `writes`), an entity's registers as a
  `fold::Product`, and which events a policy is asked about (`asks`). The
  event type is the schema; `TodoEvent<P>` is the todo schema, in the new
  `todo` module with its vocabulary `TodoVocabulary`, its register types
  `State`, `Spec` and `Content`, and its row's `todo::Reading`.
- **`fold::Product` and `fold::RegisterType`:** an entity's registers as a
  product of semilattices joined by the schema's route, with each superseding
  register's frontier by name, its conflicts, and the append's refusal
  (`grows`); a register type names its values, their order and the value a
  write gives it. `Frontier::reading` reads a frontier under one, and
  `Frontier::grows` refuses a write below an inflationary one's reading.
  `fold::read` is the one fold, over any schema.
- **`schema::Price`:** the optional price of a schema's entities, the term
  each candidate of a reading prices as (`terms`), the reading priced as
  `Least` over them, their meet in the fulfillment order (`fold::price`). An
  entity whose schema has none has no price, which is not `Absent`.
- **`schema::History`, `schema::Bind` and `schema::Row`**, each what only a
  schema that has it implements, the todo's at any payload: `History: Price`
  is a price that changes with the entity's history, the terms of each
  `moment` that `fold::flatten` makes a piece of §6.4's function; `Bind` is
  what FPL's `Ref`s read of an entity in this store (`fold::env`), its key a
  string; `Row` is what a §6.7 row shows (`Reading`, `reading`) and when it
  is provisional (`disputes`, `unconfirmed`). `view::entries` asks for all
  three; a `Ref` to an entity in another store is a host's environment,
  passed in, never a schema's method.
- `event::ENVELOPE_SIGNATURES` and `todo::TODO_SIGNATURES`, the two halves of
  what `EVENT_SIGNATURES` was.
- SPEC law 33, a reading is a function of the object set, over the todo
  schema and a review schema in the tests (`core/tests/all/review.rs`,
  `schema_laws.rs`), which also drive law 32 through the store's append.
- SPEC law 34, a conflict prices as `Least` over its candidates' terms,
  stated over `Price` and run over the todo schema and the review schema,
  which is priced by a flat term per phase.

- **`fold::Order` (SPEC §6):** a partial order on a register's values, with
  `Discrete` (the default), `Total` and inclusion on a set as instances;
  `fold::maximal` and `Frontier::read` are the completion, a register's
  reading as the maximal values of its frontier. `fold::Inflationary`
  declares a register that may only grow, and `fold::grows` is the refusal an
  append of a write that goes back meets; no todo register supersedes a write
  it could refuse, so the store calls it from stage 2's schemas. SPEC laws
  30–32 and their evidence, `core/tests/all/order_laws.rs`.

- **`Absent`, a new leaf of `TermF` (SPEC §7):** `∅` at every instant,
  printed `Absent()`, built by `fpl::mk_absent`. `∅` is the identity of
  composition: `Conj` and `Within` mean over what has a value (`∅` when
  nothing does; `Conj([])` is still 0.5), an absent gate or `OffsetBy` delta
  is none, and every other operator passes `∅` through. `After`'s and
  `Recur`'s `pending` may be absent; a cancelled `After` is still 1.0.
- **A `Ref` to a known todo with no spec links to `Absent` (SPEC §7.2)**,
  where it was refused; `LinkError::Unknown` is now only an id the store
  has never seen, and says so. `fold::link_specs(functions, known)` takes the
  todos the store knows.
- **One list order (SPEC §6.7):** `view::list_order`, ascending in value,
  ties by id, then every row with no number, `absent` or not linking, by id.
  `prodrome list` sorts by it; prodrome-wasm's `entries` answers it as
  `order`; the Typst package lists by it (`listed`, which replaces
  `by-fulfillment`) and sorts nothing itself.
- prodrome-wasm: `fold` answers `functions`, every todo the objects mention
  with its function or `absent`, which is what `link` binds against; the JSON
  codec has `{"kind": "absent"}`.
- `fpl::holds_absent`. The chain compiler writes a cancelled link over a body
  holding an `Absent` as `Gate(body, Flat(1.0))`, since an offset of `∅` is
  `∅`; an `Absent`-free body is still `Offset(1.0, body)`.
- **SPEC law 18** and its evidence: `core/tests/fpl_laws.rs` (an absent
  member changes no conjunction, a term without `Absent` has a value
  everywhere, `∅` composes as §7 says, `explain` carries it and gives it no
  share, an exact term's knots are its curve), whose generators, moved to
  `core/tests/common/terms.rs`, now draw `Absent` so laws 5, 13 and 14 cover
  it too; `core/tests/fold_laws.rs` (a `Ref` links to `Absent` for a known
  todo with no function, and every row reads that link).
  `conformance/absent/{fpl,series,view}.py` are NEW and SEEDED like the view
  vectors, by `core/examples/generate_absent_vectors.rs`, run by hand.

- **`typst-wasm/`**, Typst 0.15.1 compiled to WebAssembly
  (`nix build .#prodrome-typst-wasm`), in a cargo workspace of its own so the
  core's lock file never sees it. Exports `compile_html(source, files)` (the
  HTML document or diagnostics with spans, as a value, never a throw),
  `highlight`, `complete`, `hover` and `add_font`; every offset is UTF-16.
  The module is 22.0 MB, 6.3 MB with brotli.
- **`typst-wasm/` for views**: `Project`, a world kept between compilations
  as typst-cli's watch mode keeps one. A host sets each view module on its
  own (`set(key, text)`, `remove(key)`): a file set again unchanged keeps its
  parse and its hash, and an edited one is `Source::replace`d, so only the
  edit reparses. The state is each compilation's own argument
  (`compile(main, state)`, read as `/state.json`), never one JSON object of
  every file. `Project.restricted()` compiles markup whose author is not
  trusted: its library has no `html` module and no `plugin`, under any name,
  `eval` and `std` included, and completion there offers neither.
  `Project.complete` and `Project.hover` answer over a file of the project.
  `compile_html`, `highlight`, and `complete` and `hover` (typst-ide) are
  each a cargo feature, all on by default, so `prodrome-typst-wasm` is the
  viewer's module as before; `nix build .#prodrome-typst-wasm-views` is
  `Project` and `highlight`, and `.#prodrome-typst-wasm-editor` adds
  typst-ide. Each writes `web/typst_bg.wasm.br` (brotli, quality 11) beside
  the wasm, for a host to serve precompressed.
  `checks.prodrome-typst-wasm-bench` times a 250-item page and a keystroke,
  old export against new (`typst-wasm/bench/views.mjs`), and
  `checks.prodrome-typst-wasm-tests` runs clippy, pedantic, over every
  feature set. What each feature costs, after `wasm-opt -Os`:

  | module (`nix build .#…`)    | features                | raw         | brotli     |
  | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
  | `prodrome-typst-wasm`        | oneshot, highlight, ide | 22 064 360  | 6 266 825  |
  | `prodrome-typst-wasm-editor` | highlight, ide          | 22 054 373  | 6 268 139  |
  | `prodrome-typst-wasm-views`  | highlight               | 21 824 480  | 6 209 471  |

  Feature by feature, in bytes: `ide` 230 600 raw and 66 000 brotli,
  `oneshot` 10 000 and 3 900, `highlight` 2 400 and nothing measurable, the
  parser being the compiler's own. So an editor costs its host 1% more if it
  loads `-editor` instead of `-views`, and a second, lazily loaded module
  would cost it 6.3 MB more.

  Little, because link-time optimisation already drops what no export
  reaches: the module is the compiler and the data its dependencies embed,
  which no feature of this crate can leave out.
- **`typst/`**, the `prodrome-typst` package: the roadmap list ordered by
  fulfillment, an item's page, and two marks: a value's pie beside its
  percentage, and a todo's thirty days (fifteen back, fifteen ahead) as one
  thick line, the past faded, in a 0–100% frame. Every value is drawn in
  `colour(v)`, a sample of one continuous OKLCH gradient from red to green;
  Problem, Watch and Fine are words only. Instants read as dates, and an item's
  price in words ("42% now, falling from 55% to 5% by Sep 29, 17:00, over 3
  days"), with its explanation's parts beneath it. It reads the core's JSON
  and computes nothing about fulfillment. `checks.prodrome-typst` compiles
  its examples to PDF and HTML, and its laws (`tests/laws.typ`).
- **`viewer/`**, the static web app (`nix build .#prodrome-viewer`), with
  routes `#/` and `#/todo/<id>`, a Typst editor demo on the item page, and a
  service worker that caches the shell per build and the objects forever. It
  never scrolls sideways at a phone's width, and its smoke test checks the
  list against `prodrome list`'s order at 420px.
  `viewer/assemble.sh` puts any store's objects beside it.
- **`.github/workflows/pages.yml`** deploys it on pushes to `main`, by hand,
  and after `roadmap-data`'s `verify` succeeds on a push (`workflow_run`: a
  push trigger for that orphan branch would never fire from `main`).
- `prodrome-wasm`: `entries` also answers `created`, each todo's first
  `Created` instant and last `Created` text, the body `prodrome list` shows
  for a todo with no record. Additive; the rows are unchanged.
- **`prodrome-github PAYLOAD.json`**, in its own crate `github/`, apart from
  the core and its CLI: one GitHub webhook delivery, `issues` or
  `issue_comment`, applied to a store. An opened issue becomes item
  `gh-<number>` (a `Created` and a record with the title as its body, the
  issue's URL as its `source.message_id`, category `issue` and a flat 80%); a
  retitle is a content revision with no spec; closed is `Completed` and
  reopened is `Reopened`. A `/price` comment by an OWNER, MEMBER or
  COLLABORATOR is a `SpecRevised` written as the commenter: `/price 40`,
  `/price 30 --deadline 2026-10-15 [--end N] [--lead-up DAYS]`, `/price ref
  gh-7`, or `/price accept`, which re-issues `pricing-bot`'s latest proposal.
  Anyone else's `/price` is ignored before it is parsed. `--proposal FILE`
  records a pricing reply's `/price` line as a claim by `pricing-bot`, dated no
  earlier than what its deps rest on, so it keeps §3's clock rule for a
  reader who names the bot untrusted. Deterministic and offline: every
  instant comes off the payload, and a delivery already applied appends
  nothing. Pinned by fixture payloads and two properties — replaying what was
  applied changes nothing, and close then reopen folds to open.
- **`.github/workflows/mirror.yml`** runs that verb on every issue event and
  `/price` comment and pushes the result to `roadmap-data`, welcoming each new
  issue once with its item link.
- **`.github/workflows/price.yml`**: Claude, with no tools and one turn,
  proposes a price for each new or edited issue; a job without the model
  records it as a `pricing-bot` claim and posts it.
- `docs/github-agent.md`: the flow and its trust boundaries.
- `Price::DEFAULT_START`, `DEFAULT_END` and `DEFAULT_LEAD_UP_DAYS` in
  `prodrome-cli`, so `--deadline` and `/price … --deadline` write one decay.
- **Three objects (SPEC §3):** `Genesis(label, nonce)` begins a prodrome and
  its name is the prodrome's identity; `Change(genesis, deps, event)` is an
  event over the frontiers of the registers it writes, so its deps never
  leave its todo; `Snapshot(genesis, tips, previous)` attests everything its
  tips rest on, chained to the snapshot before. Modules `genesis`, `change`
  and `snapshot`, and `event::event_id`, an event's name apart from where it
  was written.
- **`EventStore::init(label)`** writes a store's `Genesis`, once;
  **`snapshot()`** writes a `Snapshot` of the genesis's tips, or answers the
  last one when nothing is new; `in_genesis(genesis)` names the prodrome a
  handle writes into, for a store that holds several. `prodrome init` writes
  the genesis, and **`prodrome snapshot`** is new.
- **`Least(terms)`, a new node of `TermF` (SPEC §7):** the minimum of the
  members that have a value, `Absent` its identity; exact, its breakpoints
  including the crossings; `fpl::mk_least` and `least_of`, and
  `{"kind": "least"}` in prodrome-wasm's JSON.
- **`dag::Dag`**, the DAG as a value: tips, closure, linearisation, the
  geneses and each object's, the nodes the registers read, and `verify` as
  `dag::Finding`s. `registers::deps_for` is what `append` depends on.
- `verify` reports five new findings, each by name: an object naming a
  genesis the store does not hold, an edge between geneses, a dep another
  dep rests on, a dep writing no register its change's event writes, and an
  object a snapshot attests that the store lacks.
- **SPEC laws 19–29** and their evidence: `core/tests/all/change.rs` (a name
  is its genesis, event and view; replaying writes nothing; deps name one
  todo; geneses are disjoint; a snapshot attests its closure; placement is
  not identity, over two plain stores), `fold_laws.rs` (one candidate reads
  as before, a conflict is its most urgent world, any linear extension folds
  alike, a claim settles nothing), `fpl_laws.rs` (`Least` is a
  semilattice), and `conformance/change.py`, NEW and written by hand.

### Changed (breaking)

- **A `Piecewise` holds a schedule:** `TermF::Piecewise(Schedule<A>)`,
  where it had `head` and `pieces`; `fpl::in_force` is gone, being
  `Schedule::since`. `mk_piecewise` refuses what it refused, with the same
  message. The wasm `History` (`series_knots`'s argument) refuses a todo's
  bindings out of order, which it read wrongly before; `fold`'s own
  `history` is always in order.
- **`EventStore::fsck` sets aside every file failing its hash**, then
  verifies, where `EventStore::quarantine(name)` set aside one named file;
  `prodrome fsck` replaces `prodrome quarantine <name>`, and a read's
  refusal names it. `verify` (and `prodrome verify`) still changes nothing.
  Unreleased API only: `quarantine` never shipped in a release.

- **`Dag::nodes_across_gaps` is gone**: a set of objects missing a parent
  reads as its `Dag::interior()`, whose `nodes()` never refuses one, and
  `EventStore::dag` answers that interior (SPEC §3, law 40).

- **Only a `Dag` makes a `registers::Node`** (SPEC §3, §8): `Node::of` is
  gone and the fields are private, read by `name()`, `parents()`,
  `event()`, `genesis()` and `into_event()`. An object's prodrome is a
  function of the set it is in, since a `Change` naming a legacy root is in
  the legacy prodrome and nothing in its bytes says so; a node made of one
  envelope put such a change in a prodrome of its own. A caller folds
  `Dag::nodes()`, and a test that built nodes by hand builds the objects
  and collects them into a `Dag`. Two compile-fail doctests pin it.

- **A schema's vocabulary is a value (design §5, stage 10):**
  `Schema::Vocabulary` asks `Clone + Debug + Send + Sync` and no longer
  `Default`; `Schema::from_value`, `parse_event`, `parse_envelope`,
  `Envelope::from_value`, `Change::from_call`, `dag::decode`,
  `Dag::from_prints` and `memory::receive` take the schema they parse at;
  `Schema::REGISTERS` is `Schema::registers(vocabulary)`, and
  `fold::Product` gains `registers`, which `conflicts` reads.
  `EventStore::new`, `MemoryStore::default` and the wasm's `Replica::of`
  stay, for a schema whose vocabulary has a `Default`. The wasm's `Json`
  names its key field and registers off the schema value (`Json::KEY` is
  `Json::key_field`, `Json::register` takes the schema).
- **A change's deps are its entity's heads (SPEC §3):** `registers::deps_for`
  answers every write to the entity, in any register, that no other write
  to it descends from (`registers::heads`), so the store on disk, the store
  in memory, the overlay, a `Decision` and the wasm `append` all write
  them. Supersession is unchanged and per register (§6.6): a write still
  supersedes exactly the writes to its own registers it descends from.
  `verify` accepts a dep in any register of the change's entity, and
  reports one of another entity (`Finding::Foreign`, where
  `Finding::Unwritten` reported a dep in no register the change writes).
  `conformance/change.py`'s written objects and answers are derived again
  under the rule; its bases, verify rows and prices are as they were. A
  host changes nothing but what it expects of new objects' deps; one that
  stamped its own writes instants apart to order them may stop.

- **`EventStore::dag` answers `Arc<Dag<E>>`**, the memory's, where it
  answered a copy; a caller that needs an owned `Dag` clones it.
  `EventStore<E, Pol>` asks `E: Schema` of its type. `EventStore::load`
  rereads one file and no longer feeds anything. `adopt` and
  `adopt_objects` refuse a store holding a file that does not verify, as
  every read of it does; quarantining the file first, then adopting the
  object back, is the repair.

- **`fold::Product` has a required method, `reading`**: a product names its
  registers' types, which only it knows. An implementation answers each
  register's `Frontier::reading` under that register's type.

- **A store's type parameter is its schema, the event type, where it was the
  payload.** `EventStore<P, Pol>` is `EventStore<TodoEvent<P>, Pol>`, and so
  `Dag`, `Envelope`, `Change`, `registers::{Node, Stamp, Folded, Prodrome}`,
  `fold::Frontier`, `decode`, `parse_envelope`, `parse_event` and
  `EventVocabulary`. `Policy<P>` is `Policy<E: Schema>`, and asks about
  `&E`: a call through a blanket policy (`Untrusted`, `Everything`) on an
  `Arc<E>` or a `&&E` names the event, `policy.standing(&*stamp.event)`.
- `Folded::todos` is `Folded::entities`. `registers::deps_for` answers a
  `Result`, refusing a write an inflationary register would refuse.
- `fold::Registers::read(stream, at, policy)` is `fold::read(stream, at,
  policy)`; `frontier` and `conflicts` are `fold::Product` methods, so a
  caller imports the trait. `fold::env` takes any `Bind`, `fold::flatten`
  any `History`, and `fold::link_specs` any key that reads as a string.
- **`view::Entry` is `Entry<E: Row>`:** `todo` is `key`; `outcome` and
  `content` are the todo `reading`'s fields, `entry.reading.outcome` and
  `entry.reading.content`, read by `Entry::outcome()` and
  `Entry::content()`; `claim` is the claimed `todo::Reading`;
  `conflicts` is keyed by the schema's register names (`fold::Kind` for a
  todo); `list_order` is generic.
- `EVENT_SIGNATURES` is gone: `event::ENVELOPE_SIGNATURES` and
  `todo::TODO_SIGNATURES` are its halves.

- **A value is `Option<f64>`**, `None` being `∅`, so it cannot be read as a
  number: `fpl::fulfillment`, `Compiled::fulfillment`, `Explanation::value`
  and `breaks::Knot::value`. prodrome-wasm's `fulfillment` answers
  `undefined` for `∅`, and a knot or an explanation node `null`.
- **Every `view::Entry` has a function:** `Priced` is `Price` and
  `Entry::priced: Option<Priced>` is `Entry::price: Price`, whose `spec` is
  `Absent` where the todo has no spec and no checklist and whose `value` is
  `Result<Option<f64>, LinkError>`. `Entry::spec` answers `&Term` and
  `Entry::value` a number, `∅` or the `LinkError`.
- On the wire an entry's `value` is a number, `"absent"`, or `null` where it
  does not link, and its `spec` is always a print. `prodrome show` prints
  `price absent` and the spec `Absent()`; `prodrome list` shows `∅` in the
  price column (`—` still marks a function that does not link).
- The Typst package reads `order` from its data, and draws `"absent"` and
  `null` values as unpriced; the viewer marks every todo the store knows.
- The frozen view vectors change in exactly their unpriced rows, which now
  read `value='absent'` and `spec='Absent()'`.
- **`prodrome::term` holds the functor:** `Term`, `TermF`, `CurvePoint` and
  `normalize` move there from `fpl`. `TermF::traverse` is the one function
  that names every field; `map` borrows the layer, `as_ref` joins
  `children`, and `transpose` is gone. `Term::cata`, `try_cata`, `para` and
  `any` fold a term, `breaks::Breaks` is a monoid whose `Default` is its
  identity (`exact: true`), and `breaks::constant` is gone.

- **`append(event)` writes a `Change` (SPEC §3)**, and nothing when the
  prodrome already holds an event that prints the same, answering the first
  object carrying it; its `parents` argument and the sealing on every tip
  are gone. A store needs a genesis to append to: `init` one, or a legacy
  store's root is its genesis. `merge` stays, for a legacy store's tips.
- **A register reads as its candidates (SPEC §6):** the distinct events of
  its frontier, twins one. `Folded::chosen`, `chosen_of` and the
  linearisation's pick are gone, and so are the sequential folds
  (`chronological`, `env_at`, `specs_at`, `authored_at`), `fold::Binding`,
  `fold::Env` and `evaluation_env`: `fold::env`, `specs`, `content` and
  `flatten` project a todo's registers at an instant, keyed by `(genesis,
  todo)`, and answer `fpl::Env`, whose outcomes are `fpl::Candidates`.
  `After` reads the least of its candidates, and `flatten` writes `Least`
  over a conflict's worlds.
- **`view::Entry`** carries its `genesis`, its `outcome` and `claim` as
  candidate sets, and `content` as the candidate records' names;
  `list_order` breaks ties by `(genesis, id)`.
- `store::tips_of` and `linearise` are `Dag` methods; `registers::nodes_of`
  is `Dag::nodes`; `read_dag`, `read_dag_named`, `read_dag_at`,
  `objects_from` and `read_chain` are gone.
- prodrome-wasm: an outcome in conflict crosses as the array of its
  candidates, `null` for open, in `fold`'s `env` and in an entry (`state`
  joined by `|`). `fold`'s `history.bindings` is each todo's state register
  read at every instant the reading changes, ascending, where it was every
  binding write in chain order; `series_knots` reads either. Over the pinned
  DAG, no knot moves. `verify_objects`' `genesis` lists `Genesis` objects
  and legacy roots, never a change with no deps. No export is added or
  removed.
- prodrome-github leaves a replay to `append` rather than filtering the
  prints the store holds, and dates a claim past what its deps rest on
  rather than past every event in the store.
- `conformance/dag.py`: the `env` of seeds 9, 27 and 34, whose state is in
  conflict, reads as the candidate set (law 22). Nothing else moves.

### Changed

- **CI: the pull request loop is about a minute (README, Testing).** A
  pull request's `cargo` job runs fmt, clippy and the workspace's tests
  with the flake's toolchain, in a `target/` restored from main's last
  run, and recompiles only the crates whose sources it changed: freshness
  is decided by the git blob names of what an artefact was built from
  (`.github/scripts/target-sources.sh`), not by checkout times. Each
  property law runs at most `PRODROME_MAX_CASES` cases, 32 on a pull
  request, through one rule every law's configuration now goes through
  (`core/tests/common/cases.rs`); main and a new nightly run take every
  law's full count, the nightly with fresh seeds. `nix flake check` stays
  the gate on main and runs beside the loop on a pull request. No law,
  vector or stored byte changes.

### Fixed

- **`fsck` quarantines what fails its hash and loses no byte (SPEC §3,
  law 40).** One damaged file stopped every read until someone named it to
  `quarantine`; `fsck` now finds and moves every such file, durably and
  under the lock, names each in its report, and never overwrites one set
  aside before (a second file under one name lands beside it). The store
  then reads the history without the object and everything resting on it.
  Law: `quarantine_is_the_down_set_without_what_rests_on_it` in
  `core/tests/all/down_set.rs`; `prodrome-cli`'s verbs.
- **A store reads the largest down-set it holds (SPEC §3, law 40).** A
  store missing an object (set aside, or not arrived) read every other
  object across the gap: an object resting on the missing one was folded,
  was a tip, and was a head an append wrote over, though no replica that
  lacks the object could hold it, and `events()` and the CLI's reads
  refused outright on the missing parent. The store's history is now the
  interior of its objects, `Dag::interior`, every object whose ancestors
  are all held; one outside it waits, verified, and joins when what it
  rests on arrives. `Dag::nodes_across_gaps` is gone. Laws:
  `core/tests/all/down_set.rs`.
- **Every file the store writes is written durably (SPEC §3).** One write
  serves them all: a randomly named temp in the target's own directory,
  synced, renamed, and the directory synced. A directory the store makes
  (the root, `objects/`, `quarantine/`) was not synced into its parent, so
  a crash could lose a fresh store's `objects/` with every object synced
  inside it; each is now synced into its parent as it is made.
- **The store writes its own `.gitattributes` (SPEC §3, README).** The
  attribute that keeps git from rewriting an object's bytes was documented
  and only this repository carried it, so a store elsewhere in a repository
  was unprotected. A write to a store with no `.gitattributes` in its root
  writes one, `objects/** -text -diff` and `quarantine/** -text -diff`, and
  one that is there is never rewritten. `verify` names a temp the root's
  write left (`Finding::Garbage` is now a path within the store). Tests:
  `the_gitattributes_is_written_durably_and_never_rewritten`,
  `a_directory_is_made_with_its_ancestors` and, now asserting the store
  reads as it did, `a_crash_before_the_rename_leaves_only_a_temp`, in
  `core/src/store.rs`.
- **A mixed store reads each todo as one stream.** A caller folding a store
  of legacy objects and changes object by object (`Node::of`) split a todo
  whose changes name the legacy root into two prodromes; nodes now come
  only from the DAG, which places every such change with the `Sealed`s of
  its todo. Test: `a_mixed_store_folds_a_todo_as_one_stream` in
  `core/tests/all/registers.rs`.
- **A handle sees a file change under a name it has read (SPEC §3).** The
  parent index a handle kept said what it gave up: an object tampered with
  after the handle verified it was not noticed by `tips()`. The memory keeps
  each file's `stat` instead, and a file that no longer looks as it did is
  read and verified again before anything is read from memory. Test:
  `a_file_changed_under_a_held_name_is_read_again`.
- **A write is durable (SPEC §3).** An object was written to `<name>.tmp`
  and renamed with no sync, so a power loss could leave a zero-length file
  under a name that promises content. It is now written to a randomly named
  temp file created exclusively, synced before the rename, and `objects/` is
  synced once per append or adoption. Law: a crash between the write and the
  rename leaves no object, only a temp that `verify` reports
  (`a_crash_before_the_rename_leaves_only_a_temp` in `core/src/store.rs`).
- **`verify` sees everything in `objects/` (SPEC §3).** It looked at `.py`
  files only, so a temp an interrupted write left, or any other stray, was
  never reported. Every entry that is not `<name>.py` for a well-formed name
  is now a finding, by name; the reads pass over such entries rather than
  refusing a `.py` whose stem is not a name. Law: `verify_names_every_stray`
  in `core/src/store.rs`.
- **One damaged object no longer stops every write (SPEC §3).** `tips()`
  refused a store holding a file that fails its hash, and `append` asks
  `tips()`, so one such file stopped the store with no way out. It still
  refuses rather than guess, and now names the object and the fix:
  `EventStore::quarantine(name)`, and `prodrome quarantine <name>`, move a
  file failing its hash from `objects/` to `quarantine/` (a file that hashes
  to its name is refused), after which the store answers and `verify`
  reports a receipt for the quarantined file until the object is restored.
  Test: `after_quarantine_the_store_answers_and_verify_holds_the_receipt` in
  `core/src/store.rs`, and `prodrome-cli`'s verbs.
- **Git must not rewrite object bytes (SPEC §3, README).** A store under git
  needs `objects/** -text -diff` in its `.gitattributes`, or a line-ending
  conversion leaves files that no longer hash to their names; documented,
  and added to this repository's own `.gitattributes`.
- `breaks::series_knots` puts a knot a second before a jump that falls
  exactly on the window's end, as it does for every other jump, instead of
  drawing a ramp across it. No frozen series moves.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes.** `Absent` is a new constructor; a record whose `spec`
  is `None` reads as `Absent` at the todo, and `flatten` is unchanged, so an
  old store reads as before except that a `Ref` to an unpriced todo now
  links. Every reference vector answers what it answered.
- `Genesis`, `Change`, `Snapshot` and `Least` are new constructors, and
  `Sealed` and `Woven` are read as ever. A store with none of the new
  objects derives, linearises and verifies exactly as it did, and reads as
  it did wherever no register holds two candidates.
- Every object written before a change's deps became its entity's heads
  keeps its deps and reads exactly as it did: `conformance/dag.py`, every
  other vector, `wasm/snapshots/dag-1.txt` and
  `wasm/conformance/term-json.json` are unchanged. A replay of an event the
  prodrome holds still writes nothing: the twin check compares the event,
  not the deps.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-27

A MINOR version under this file's rule: no stored object
changes, every vector answers what it answered, and the API breaks where the
heads used to be. A store's tips are DERIVED from its objects (SPEC §3), so a
store is its `objects/` and nothing else, and a `git merge` of two clones of a
store is the Prodrome's own union with nothing that can conflict.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Tips are derived (SPEC §3):** the objects no object names as a parent.
  `store::tips_of` is the pure function; `EventStore::tips` applies it to the
  store and is now fallible (`Result<BTreeSet<Hash>, _>`), since it reads
  every object it has not verified.
- **`HEAD` and `refs/` are gone, not cached.** Nothing needed them: every read
  already loaded the objects, the objects imply exactly the heads the files
  named (law 17, checked on every `conformance/dag.py` store laid out as the
  0.8 writer left it), and a cache is a second record of the heads that can
  disagree with the first — which in a git-tracked store is also the one file
  two clones can conflict on, the thing this change exists to remove. Old
  stores READ unchanged; the store never writes or deletes those files, and
  `verify` reports each as a leftover, so dropping them (`git rm HEAD refs`)
  is an explicit act. This repository's own `roadmap/HEAD` is removed; the
  tip derived is the tip it named.
- `EventStore::tip` is removed. "The" tip of a store with two is not a
  question with an answer; callers ask `tips`.
- `append(event, None)` seals on EVERY tip: none is genesis, one is a
  `Sealed` byte for byte as before, several is a `Woven` carrying the event.
  In 0.8 it sealed on `HEAD` alone and left the other head standing; now the
  next write after a union settles it. `merge(None, _)` joins every tip, as
  before.
- `verify` no longer reports an unreachable object or a stale head (neither
  can exist: every object is a tip or beneath one), nor anything about HEAD
  and `refs/` agreeing; it reports a leftover `HEAD` or `refs/`. Every
  missing parent is reported, not only the first a walk reached. An object
  that nothing names — once an "orphan" — is a tip.
- `adopt`/`adopt_objects` verify every object before writing any, and write
  parents before children, because an object is in the store the moment its
  file is: a refused adoption leaves nothing behind, and a crash mid-adoption
  leaves a store closed under parents. There is no placement step left.
- `prodrome-wasm`: `verify_objects(objects)` derives the tips from the
  objects it was handed (the `tips` argument is gone) and answers them.

### Added

- `EventStore::objects`, every object by name, reverified — the one read the
  others are taken from; `read_dag` is one pass over the files.
- **A parent index** in each `EventStore` handle (shared by its clones): name
  → parents for every object it has verified, so `tips` is a directory
  listing plus the objects it has not seen. A memo of a pure function (a
  name is the hash of its bytes), so it needs no invalidation, and a deleted
  file is simply no longer listed. Measured in release, on a synthetic store
  of 1000 objects (366 KB): 39 ms to derive by loading everything, 2.8 ms
  warm through the index, against 2.6 µs to read 0.8's `HEAD`; 0.6 ms for all
  40 `dag.py` stores. The one thing it gives up, stated and test-pinned: a
  handle that verified an object before it was tampered with keeps its
  parents for `tips`. Every read of the objects, and `verify`, rehash every
  file.
- **SPEC law 17** and its evidence: `core/tests/tips.rs` (a union's tips
  compose, and two stores' files in one directory derive them; the listing
  order does not matter; the tips cover the store and none rests on another,
  on random DAGs, pure and on disk); `core/tests/fold_laws.rs` (two writers'
  unioned directories read, fold and view as their `adopt`-merge, and the
  next append weaves what a merge would); `core/tests/dag.rs` (derived tips
  equal the old `HEAD`/`refs/` on every conformance store). The vectors are
  unchanged.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-25

A MINOR version: recurrence, as one new event kind and two new terms. No
stored byte changes and every existing vector answers what it answered; the
environment's type grows a second half, and every caller follows it.

### Added

- **`Tended(todo, at, actor, note)`, a new event kind (SPEC §4):** a pass at
  a todo that is never done. It changes no state, spec or content, and it puts
  no piece in `flatten`. `event::mk_tended`; the reference policy lets a
  roster actor's tending only claim, like a completion.
- **The tendings (SPEC §6.1):** per todo, the instant of every binding
  `Tended`, a grow-only set folded by union. `env_at`, `history` and the
  registers carry it; a tending writes no register, so concurrent tendings
  are their union and never a conflict. `fpl::last_tended(env, todo, now)` is
  the latest tending at or before `now`.
- **`Recur(todo, anchor, term, pending)` (SPEC §7.3):** `term`, authored
  against `anchor`, re-anchored to the last tending of `todo` as `After` is to
  a completion; `pending` before the first. `mk_recur` refuses a `todo`
  `TodoId` would refuse. Its explanation notes `bound` (`pending` or
  `tended`), and when tended, `tended` and `agoHours`.
- **`Periodic(period, anchor, term)` (SPEC §7.3):** `term` read at `anchor +
  ((now − anchor) mod period)`, the remainder Euclidean, so moments before
  `anchor` repeat too. `mk_periodic` refuses a period that is not positive.
  Its explanation notes `cycleStart`.
- `fpl::phase(period, anchor, now)`, the instant a `Periodic` reads.
- The chain compiler resolves a `Recur` into the schedule its tendings make:
  pending before the first, and from each tending the body slid by its
  slippage. §9.13 now quantifies over tendings too.
- **SPEC laws 15 and 16** and their evidence: `core/tests/fold_laws.rs` draws
  `Tended` among the generated kinds and checks a tending changes no state,
  spec, content, function, register or entry, and that tendings merge by
  union; `core/tests/fpl_laws.rs` checks `last_tended` reads as of now,
  `Recur` re-anchors, waits and ignores later tendings, `Periodic` repeats,
  and both round-trip and refuse what they must. `conformance/recur.py` is
  NEW and written BY HAND: `Tended` prints folded under the reference policy,
  a claimed pass among them, and readings to 1e-9. `Recurs` and `RecurCase`
  join the vector vocabulary.
- `prodrome-wasm`: `lifecycle` spells `Tended`; the JSON codec has `recur`
  (`todo`, `anchor`, `term`, `pending`) and `periodic` (`periodHours`,
  `anchor`, `term`).

### Changed (breaking)

- `fold::Env` and `fpl::Env` are structs, `outcomes` beside `tended`
  (`TodoId`/`String` → `BTreeSet<Instant>`), where they were maps of
  outcomes. A caller that read the map reads `env.outcomes`; `Env::new()` is
  still the empty environment. `fold::History` holds the tendings too and
  answers them from `tended()`.
- `TodoEvent` has a `Tended` arm; an exhaustive match gains one.
- The wasm environment crosses as `{"outcomes": {…}, "tended": {"<todo>":
  ["<iso>", …]}}`, both in `fold`'s `env` and in what `fulfillment`,
  `explain` and `compile` read; `fold`'s `history` is `{"bindings": {…},
  "tended": {…}}`, which `series_knots` reads. A half left out is empty, so
  `{}` is still the empty environment; any other key, the old bare map
  included, is refused.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes**, and every existing conformance vector: `Tended`,
  `Recur` and `Periodic` are new constructors, and a store without them reads
  exactly what it read before. `flatten` gains no case.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-25

A MINOR version: a new constructor, and the evaluator's signatures move so
that an unbound reference is a type error. No stored byte changes, and every
existing vector answers what it answered.

### Added

- **`Ref(todo)`, a new FPL leaf (SPEC §7.2):** the fulfillment of another
  todo, for subtodos and groups whose demand is composed from other todos'.
  It prints as `Ref(todo='<id>')`; `mk_ref` and the parse refuse an id
  `TodoId` would refuse. A term holding one is OPEN.
- **`fpl::link(term, specs) -> Result<Closed, LinkError>`:** every `Ref(x)`
  replaced by `specs[x]`, recursively — bind for the free monad over `TermF`.
  A rebuilt `Piecewise` goes back through the normal form. Refusals are
  values: `LinkError::Unknown(id)`, and `LinkError::Cycle(path)`, found on
  the path being expanded, so `link` is total and never loops.
- `fpl::Closed`, a term with no `Ref`: `Closed::of(term) -> Option<Closed>`,
  `term()`, `into_term()`, `normalize()`. `TermF::transpose`, the traversal
  in `Result` that `link` is written with. `From<LinkError> for
  ProdromeError`.
- `fold::link_specs(&flatten(…))`: a chain's functions as `link` reads them,
  so `Ref(x)` means x's whole function, its lifecycle included.
- `Entry::unlinked() -> Option<&LinkError>`.
- **SPEC law 14** and its evidence: `core/tests/fpl_laws.rs` checks a closed
  term links to itself, a reference reads what its spec reads, linking
  commutes with substitution order, the linked term is in normal form, a
  loop is refused with a real cycle, and `Ref` round-trips print and parse.
  `conformance/link.py` is NEW and written BY HAND from those laws: exact
  linked prints, readings to 1e-9, an unknown todo and a cycle refused. Its
  names, `Links`, `LinkCase` and `Refused`, join the vector vocabulary.
- `prodrome-wasm` exports `link(term, specs)`, answering the closed term in
  the JSON shape (`{"kind": "ref", "todo": …}` is the new tag). `json_entry`
  grows one key, `unlinked`.

### Changed (breaking)

- `fpl::fulfillment` and `fpl::explained` take `&Closed`, as do
  `breaks::series_knots` and `chain::compile`; `chain::compile_chain` and
  `chain::chain_order` take `&BTreeMap<String, Closed>`, and
  `Compiled::term()`/`into_term()` answer a `Closed`. A caller holding a
  `Term` with no reference wraps it with `Closed::of`; one holding a
  function from `flatten` links it with `link(term, &link_specs(&functions))`.
- `view::Priced::value` is `Result<f64, LinkError>`: the entry's value is its
  function LINKED against every todo's function (§6.7). `Entry::value()`
  still answers an `Option<f64>`, `None` where the function does not link.
- The wasm exports that evaluate refuse a term that still holds a `ref`.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes**, and every existing conformance vector: `Ref` is a new
  constructor, and a store with none reads exactly what it read before.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-10

A VERSION because the core's public API grew: `prodrome::chain` is a module a
reader can depend on. NOTHING ELSE MOVED — no stored byte changes, no vector
changes, no reading changes, and the interpreted path is the one it was.

### Added

- **`chain`, the chain compiler (SPEC §7.1).** `After` is the ONE term that
  reads history; every other constructor is a function of `now` and its
  subterms. `chain::compile(term, env)` erases it — the term comes back with
  every `After` resolved against the snapshot and `normalize`d, so a chain of
  dependencies is ONE schedule at the root instead of a freeze quantifier the
  evaluator re-enters at every sample. `Compiled`'s readers — `term`,
  `fulfillment(now)`, `explain(now)`, `notes`, `links`, `moot` — take NO
  ENVIRONMENT, which is the claim: a compiled term cannot consult one, because
  the only constructor that would is gone.
- EACH LINK IS ONE GRADED OFFSET δ ∈ [0, 1], applied with §7's corrected form.
  `x·(1 − |1|) + max(0, 1) = 1` for every `x`, so a CANCELLED upstream is
  `Offset(1.0, …)` — the moot constant written as the offset it is, with the
  demand that was dropped still in the tree where a reader can see it. δ = 0 is
  the identity and is elided, as is a zero `Shift`. A completed upstream is a
  `Piecewise` whose piece slides the body by the slippage; an unbound one is
  its pending branch and nothing else.
- A cancellation is REPORTED and never silent (§7): every link is a `Link` on
  the compiled term, `moot()` names the cancelled ones, and `explain` carries
  them at the root under `moot`. A 1.0 from a cancellation is indistinguishable
  from a 1.0 from a demand met, and the note is the only thing that tells them
  apart.
- `chain_order` and `compile_chain` take the chain as a MAP of todo to
  function — `fold::flatten`'s answer — and read the graph its links draw over
  those todos. A cycle is refused as a VALUE, `ChainError::Cycle(path)`, the
  path naming the loop; a link onto something outside the map is not an edge,
  because the snapshot answers it.
- **`After.needs` is CONSUMED, by the compiler and not by the evaluator.** §7's
  semantics have never read it and this does not start: consuming it as a value
  would move a reading. It is the link's declared LEAD TIME, and the compiler
  is the first reader holding it beside the upstream's actual instant, so a
  resolved link reports `ready = at + needs`. A host schedules by it.
- **SPEC §9.13**, the law that makes the above an OPTIMISATION and not a second
  semantics: `fulfillment(compile(t, env).term, now, ∅)` equals
  `fulfillment(t, now, env)` to 1e-9 at every instant, the compiled side read
  against the EMPTY environment. `core/tests/fpl_laws.rs` quantifies it over
  the same `a_term()` and `an_env()` §9.5 runs on, with two more properties
  beside it — no `After` survives, and an environment that answers differently
  about everything changes nothing.
- `core/tests/chain.rs` pins the cases: what each link compiles to, as an exact
  print; the cancellation report; that `needs` moves no number; the cycle and
  its message; and THE COST, as a test rather than as a claim — a chain of
  three links under one `Within` costs up to 65·3 = 195 environment lookups per
  interpreted evaluation and none at all compiled, asserted on the counting env
  in both its readings (the `After` nodes that could ask, and an environment
  that would show if one did) and never on the clock.
  MEASURED AND STATED AS MEASURED: 390 000 lookups become 0 for a 19 µs
  compile, and the wall clock moves about 7% in release, because a lookup in a
  three-entry map is cheap. What the compiler buys is that the environment
  leaves the query path — a compiled term can be cached, stored, shipped and
  evaluated where no history exists — and not a constant factor.
- `prodrome-wasm` gains ONE export, `compile(term, env)`, returning the
  compiled term's canonical print beside its links. The other exports are
  unchanged in shape and in answer.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes**, and every conformance vector. The compiler adds no
  constructor, reads no new field and changes no existing term's value; §9.8's
  150 terms answer exactly what they answered, which is the frozen pin under
  §9.13's property.
- **The interpreted path.** `fpl::fulfillment`, `fpl::explained` and
  `breaks::series_knots` are untouched, and a host that never compiles reads
  what it read before. Compiling is an optimisation a caller opts into.
- The wasm wire, apart from the one export added above.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-10

A VERSION AND NOT AN `Unreleased`: a new crate ships in the workspace and
`packages.default` changes, which are things a reader can depend on, and both
belong under a number rather than under a heading that never settles. Nothing
about the format moved.

### Added

- **`prodrome-cli`**, the `prodrome` binary, over `prodrome-core` with the
  reference payload (`reference::Todo`) and the reference policy
  (`policy::Untrusted`). The verbs: `init`, `add`, `done`, `cancel`, `reopen`,
  `revise`, `list`, `show`, `verify`, `weave`. `--store DIR` defaults to
  `./roadmap` when that directory exists and to `.` otherwise; `--actor`
  defaults to `$PRODROME_ACTOR`, then `$USER`; `--untrusted NAME,…` (or
  `$PRODROME_UNTRUSTED`) is the READER's standing policy, so one invocation
  shows the confirmed reading and the claimed one at once.
- IT IS A HOST, AND IT IS WHERE THE CLOCK IS. The core has none — an event's
  `at` is data (§4) and a fold is a query at an instant the caller names (§6) —
  so `--at` names one and the machine's clock is only what a caller who did not
  falls back to. On a write `--at` is the instant STAMPED ON the event, which
  is how a todo that became true yesterday says so.
- A price is stated as `--priority N`, a constant, or as `--deadline
  YYYY-MM-DD` with `--start`, `--end` and `--lead-up-days`, a `Decay` onto
  17:00 that day. The scale is fulfillment as a percentage, so LOW IS URGENT
  and there is no second scale to invert.
- `weave` is `EventStore::merge(None, None)`: every head into one `Woven`
  carrying no event, which is what settles a store two branches both appended
  to. No actor and no note, because a merge asserts structure and not a fact
  about a todo (§3).
- **`roadmap/`**: this crate's own todos, as a store of objects, seeded by the
  verbs above and committed like any other directory. The historical items
  carry the instants their releases were actually cut, so `prodrome list --at`
  answers about the past with what was believed then. It is the one example
  that cannot go stale: CI runs `prodrome verify --store roadmap` and
  `prodrome list --store roadmap`, so a pull request that appends to it proves
  its objects rehash and that the store still folds.
- THE STORE HOLDS NO POLICY and CI names no allowlist — 0.3's point, applied to
  this repository. Objects are content-addressed and never rewritten, so a pull
  request's diff is exactly the objects it adds, the objects are reviewed like
  code, and merging one is a maintainer's act. README's *Contributing* says it
  in those words.
- `nix build .#prodrome-cli` builds and tests the binary, and it is a
  `nix flake check` check. `packages.default` is now the binary rather than the
  wasm; `nix build .#prodrome-wasm` is unchanged. `roadmap/` is deliberately
  NOT in the flake's fileset: it is data the binary reads, not source it is
  built from, so appending a todo rebuilds nothing.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes.** No constructor, field or print changed; every object
  written by 0.1.0 through 0.4.0 parses, prints back byte for byte and hashes
  to the same name. `roadmap/` is written by the same printer that wrote the
  vectors.
- **The wasm wire**, and every conformance vector.
- `prodrome-core`'s API. The binary is a consumer of it and added nothing to
  it: `EventStore`, the folds, `view::entries` and `policy::Untrusted` are what
  the verbs are made of.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **The vectors are literals** (SPEC §2). `conformance/` held 1.9 MB of JSON
  in a crate whose claim is that there is ONE reading of its data: one closed
  grammar, one printer, one parser. Evidence written in a second format was a
  second format to keep in step. `conformance/*.py` is that evidence in the
  crate's own grammar, read by the crate's own parser against the VECTOR
  VOCABULARY — a second closed whitelist, disjoint from a store's, so a vector
  name is refused in an object and an object's kind is refused in a vector.
  Every stored object, event and term inside one is a STRING holding its
  canonical print, because those exact bytes are what a vector is evidence of
  (§9.1); instants are `datetime(...)`, and the mappings the JSON keyed by
  todo id or object name are tuples of a named constructor.
- A CHECKED MIGRATION, not a refresh: the vectors are frozen and have no
  generator left to re-run, so the converting commit read the JSON, built the
  literal, printed it, parsed it back, asserted the two values equal, mapped
  the literal back to JSON and asserted it equalled what it started from —
  exactly, no tolerance, every key and every float — for all 400 vectors, and
  ran that under `cargo test`. The counts are unchanged: 120 logs, 40 DAGs,
  150 terms, 60 windows, 30 + 30 view cases.
- **The JSON codec leaves the core.** `fpl::to_json`, `fpl::from_json`,
  `fpl::explanation_json` and `fpl::explain` are `prodrome-wasm`'s
  `json` module now — JSON is JavaScript's literal grammar and the wasm crate
  is the JavaScript boundary. The core keeps `fpl::explained`: the decoration
  is §7's, only its JSON was not. SPEC §7 no longer names `to_json` as part of
  the contract.
- `prodrome-core` depends on neither `serde` nor `serde_json`, as a dependency
  or a dev-dependency. Nothing in the crate parses a second format.
- `core/examples/generate_view_vectors.rs` emits literals, laid out one case
  per line so a diff is readable.

### Added

- `wasm/conformance/term-json.json`: the `json` and `explain` halves of what
  was `conformance/fpl.json`, unchanged, for the same 150 terms — the JSON
  boundary's evidence, in the crate where the JSON is produced.
  `wasm/src/json.rs`'s test replays all of them, and `wasm/src/wire.rs` gains
  the first test of `json_entry`'s ten keys.
- `core/tests/common/vectors.rs`: the vector vocabulary and the accessors a
  suite reads a case with. `common::entry_value` (an `Entry` as the vector
  grammar's `Row`) and `common::explanation_value` (an explanation's
  DECORATION — kind, value, notes — beside the term's own print) replace the
  copy of `json_entry` the core kept in step with the wasm crate by hand.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes.** No constructor, field or print changed; every object
  written by 0.1.0, 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 parses, prints back byte for byte and
  hashes to the same name. The format of the EVIDENCE changed; the format of
  the DATA did not.
- **The wasm wire.** Every exported function's arguments and answers are the
  shapes they were — `term_json`, `explain`, `series_knots`, `entries`,
  `fold`, `registers` included, down to the lowercase kind tags, the ISO
  instants and the spans in hours.
- **Every expected answer**, to the digit: what `conformance/*.py` says is
  what `conformance/*.json` said.


## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **Standing is the host's** (SPEC §5, rewritten). The core carried one
  deployment's trust policy: a set of untrusted actor names, plus a
  kind-dependent rule (their lifecycle events did not bind, their content
  records did), plus a `verify` clock rule keyed on the same set. None of that
  is a fact about a DAG of events — it is the same move 0.2 made for the
  record. The database now asks the HOST, one event at a time, and gets a
  `policy::Standing`: `Binds` (the folds take it) or `Claims` (stored, shown,
  never folded). Nothing in the core reads an actor name to decide anything.
- `policy::Policy<P>` is that question as a trait. One required method,
  `standing(&self, event: &TodoEvent<P>) -> Standing`; one provided method,
  `confirms(&self, event) -> bool` ("is this the host's own word"), whose
  default is `standing(event) == Binds`. Not sealed: a host implements it.
- `fold::Untrusted` is now `policy::Untrusted`, the REFERENCE policy — the
  rule `conformance/` was taken under, in the core rather than behind the
  `reference` feature, because it is a policy over the core's own event kinds
  and needs no payload. `Untrusted::none()`, `::of` and `::actors` are
  unchanged; `Untrusted::binds` is gone (ask `standing`). `policy::Everything`
  is new: the policy under which every event binds, which is what §6.7's
  CLAIMED reading is taken under.
- Every fold takes `&impl Policy<P>` where it took `&Untrusted`:
  `fold::{env_at, specs_at, flatten, history}`, `registers::{extend, fold}`,
  `view::entries`. `EventStore<P>` is now `EventStore<P, Pol = Untrusted>` and
  holds the policy by value, so `EventStore::<Todo>::new(root, policy)` takes
  an `Untrusted` where it took a `BTreeSet<Actor>`; `EventStore::policy()`
  hands it back.
- `event::binds(event, &BTreeSet<Actor>)` is gone. It was §5 hardcoded; the
  rule is `Untrusted`'s `Policy` impl now.
- `view::Standing` is `view::Confidence` and `Entry::standing` is
  `Entry::confidence` — the name went to the event-level sum, which is what
  §5 is about. `Provisional` and `Confidence::{of, is_provisional}` are
  unchanged, and `Provisional::Content` now means "the winning content record
  is one the policy does not `confirm`" rather than "its actor is untrusted".
- §3's `verify` states its clock rule through the policy: an event the policy
  does not `confirm`, dated behind any of its ancestors. Same rule, same
  findings, same wording — the reference policy `confirms` exactly the actors
  off its roster, whatever the kind, which is why it overrides the default.
- SPEC §5 is rewritten as STANDING; §3, §6.1–6.5, §6.7 and §8 quantify over
  the policy.

### Added

- SPEC §9.10–9.12, the laws that make "the host decides" honest, as proptests
  over generated logs in `core/tests/fold_laws.rs`:
  - **9.10** under the policy that binds everything, the claimed and confirmed
    readings are equal — every fold answers alike, no entry carries a claim,
    no entry is provisional (`the_two_readings_agree_under_a_policy_that_binds_everything`);
  - **9.11** a claiming event never moves the confirmed reading — append one
    and every confirmed answer at every moment is the answer it was
    (`a_claiming_event_never_moves_the_confirmed_reading`);
  - **9.12** standing selects events, not positions — folding under a policy
    is folding the sub-log of the events it binds, under any permutation of
    the log (`standing_selects_events_and_not_positions`).
- `conformance/view/*.json` (SPEC §6.7): `view::entries` had no frozen
  vectors — they were scrubbed when this crate went public, taken as they
  were on a private chain. SEEDED instead: random logs from this crate's own
  generator (`core/tests/common/mod.rs`'s `a_log`, the same one
  `core/tests/fold_laws.rs`'s properties draw from), under a fixed seed,
  folded at several instants under two reference policies (rostering
  `"triage"` and, inverted, `"bassel"`). `core/tests/conformance_view.rs`
  replays them; `core/examples/generate_view_vectors.rs` is the only thing
  that regenerates them, run by hand, never by `cargo test` or CI.

### Unchanged

- **The stored bytes.** No constructor, field or print changed; every object
  written by 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 parses, prints back byte for byte and hashes to
  the same name.
- **The wasm wire.** `fold`, `registers` and `entries` still take `untrusted`
  as a JSON array of actor names; `wire::parse_untrusted` turns that array
  into the reference policy, which is the rule the argument always meant.
  Every exported function's arguments and answers are the shapes they were,
  `entries`' `unconfirmed` included.
- **Every conformance vector**, byte for byte. `conformance/*.json`'s
  `untrusted` fields are read through the reference policy; the prints,
  hashes, linearisations, frontiers, fulfillments, entries and `verify`
  findings are the ones the vectors held.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **A record's fields are the host's** (SPEC §4). `Authored` used to name one
  deployment's schema — `kind`, `created`, `body`, `spec`, `rationale`,
  `category`, `waiting_on`, `detail`, `source`, `subtodos`, `notes`, `note` —
  inside the database. The record kind is now `KIND(todo, at, actor, <the
  host's fields>)`, where a `payload::Payload` supplies the constructor name,
  the fields and their order, the vocabulary those fields nest, their parse and
  print, and the only two readings the folds take: the spec a record carries
  and its checklist length.
- Every type that carries an event is generic over that payload:
  `Authored<P>`, `TodoEvent<P>`, `Envelope<P>`, `EventStore<P>`,
  `registers::{Node, Write, Frontier, Folded}<P>`, and the folds, registers and
  `view::entries` that read them. A type parameter and never a `dyn`: one store
  is parsed against one closed vocabulary, and that vocabulary is the core's
  names union the payload's.
- `literal::Signature` borrows its field order from the vocabulary that
  answered (`Signature<'a>`), so a vocabulary assembled at runtime can lend
  one. `Table::find` keeps the `'static` a static table has.
- `wasm`: a record crosses the boundary as its payload's own `fields()`, keyed
  by the names it stores them under, each literal mapped to JSON by the obvious
  rules. Two keys inside `content`/`records` changed shape: `created` and
  `source.date` are full ISO instants rather than `%Y-%m-%d`, and a record's
  `spec` arrives in the literal shape rather than `fpl::to_json`'s. `todo`,
  `notes`, and a `kind` tag on nested calls are new.

### Added

- `payload::Payload`, and the field readers a host's `from_fields` needs
  (`string_field`, `datetime_field`, `tuple_or_empty`, `spec_field`, …), which
  are the ones the core's own kinds are parsed with.
- `prodrome::reference`, behind the default `reference` feature: the payload
  `conformance/*.json` was taken with, `Todo`, with `Source`, `SubTodo`,
  `Note`, `NoteSite`, `MarkupSource` and `StringSource`. A worked example of
  the trait, and the fixture the conformance suites drive. Turn it off with
  `default-features = false`.
- SPEC §9.1 now says the round trip explicitly for the generic path, and
  `tests/folds.rs` checks it: every `Authored(...)` print in the vectors parses
  under the reference payload and prints back byte for byte.

### Removed

- From `prodrome::event`: `MarkupSource`, `StringSource`, `Source`, `SubTodo`,
  `Note`, `NoteSite`, `mk_authored`, `mk_source`, `mk_note`, `mk_subtodo`, and
  the record's entry in `EVENT_SIGNATURES`. All of it is in
  `prodrome::reference`, unchanged. `mk_record` is the core's constructor for a
  record now: the three fields it owns, and a payload.

### Unchanged

- The stored bytes. Every object written by 0.1.0 parses, prints back byte for
  byte and hashes to the same name under the reference payload.
- The literal grammar, `Hash`, `TodoId`, `Actor`, `Name`, the lifecycle kinds,
  `SpecRevised`, FPL, the folds' semantics, the registers' semantics, and every
  conformance vector.

## [0.1.0]

- The first public release: the literal grammar (§2), objects and the DAG (§3),
  events (§4), trust (§5), the folds and registers (§6), FPL (§7), and the
  conformance vectors the laws in §9 are checked against.
