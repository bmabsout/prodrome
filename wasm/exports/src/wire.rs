//! The JSON shapes that cross the boundary, and nothing else.
//!
//! The exports are functions of JSON text; this is what their arguments and
//! their answers LOOK like, written down once so that a page's own API module's
//! mirror has a single thing to mirror. Everything is JSON text: a string in,
//! a string out. That is deliberate — `serde-wasm-bindgen` would let a JS
//! object cross directly and cost a second serialisation format to keep in
//! step with the wire the server already speaks, and this crate's whole reason
//! to exist is that there is ONE reading of the data.
//!
//! ONE INSTANT SHAPE IN AND OUT: `fpl::iso` (`2026-09-06T11:32:07`), what
//! `datetime.isoformat()` prints and what every `at` on the JSON API carries.
//! So `fold`'s `env` can be handed straight back to `fulfillment`,
//! and `fold`'s `history` straight back to `series_knots`, with
//! nothing rewritten in between — a translation step is where a second reading
//! grows.
//!
//! A RECORD'S FIELDS ARE THE HOST'S, so this file does not name one. §4's
//! record kind is `KIND(todo, at, actor, <the payload's fields>)`, and
//! [`json_record`] serialises exactly that: the three the core owns, then the
//! payload's own `fields()` as a JSON object keyed by field name, each a §2
//! literal mapped by [`json_literal`]. A browser therefore reads the same
//! names its store holds, whatever payload the module was built with — and
//! this crate stops having an opinion about what a body is.
//!
//! `json_entry`'s `at` is `isoformat(" ")` and used to be the page's to spell;
//! since §6.7 it is `Entry::at`, in the core — one spelling, in one place.
