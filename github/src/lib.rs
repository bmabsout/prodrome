//! `prodrome-github`: one GitHub webhook delivery, as the events it means.
//!
//! THE MIRROR IS A FUNCTION OF THE PAYLOAD AND THE STORE, AND OF NOTHING ELSE.
//! Every instant written here is read off the payload (`created_at`,
//! `updated_at`, `closed_at`), never off a clock, and nothing here reaches a
//! network. So the same delivery, applied to the same store, always means the
//! same events — which is what lets a replay append nothing: `append` writes
//! nothing for an event its prodrome already holds (SPEC §3).
//!
//! The payload is the JSON a workflow finds at `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. Two event
//! names are read, `issues` and `issue_comment`, and told apart by the payload
//! itself (only a comment delivery carries `comment`), so the input is one file
//! and a test is one fixture.
//!
//! WHO WRITES WHAT. Facts GitHub asserts — an issue was opened, retitled,
//! closed, reopened — are written as [`MIRROR`]. A `/price` comment is written
//! as the commenter, and only when GitHub says the commenter is the
//! repository's owner, a member or a collaborator; anyone else's `/price` is
//! ignored before its text is even parsed. A proposal from the pricing step is
//! written as [`BOT`], which a reader passes to `--untrusted` to see it as the
//! CLAIM it is (§5).
