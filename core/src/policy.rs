//! §5 — STANDING: does this event bind, or does it only claim?
//!
//! See ../../SPEC.md. Every fold in [`crate::fold`], the register action in
//! [`crate::registers`], the composition in [`crate::view`] and §3's `verify`
//! ask exactly this one question about an event, and a [`Policy`] — the HOST's
//! — is what answers it.
//!
//! THE DATABASE DOES NOT DECIDE WHOM TO BELIEVE. Which writers a deployment
//! stands behind is not a fact about a DAG of events, any more than what a
//! record MEANS is (§4, and the same move: 0.2 made the record the host's,
//! 0.3 makes the standing the host's). The core carried one deployment's
//! answer — a set of untrusted actor names, plus a kind-dependent rule — and
//! that answer is now [`Untrusted`], the REFERENCE policy: still here, still
//! what `conformance/` was taken under, and no longer something the folds
//! know.
//!
//! WHAT STAYS IN THE CORE is the two-reading fold: the CONFIRMED environment
//! and the CLAIMED one, side by side in [`crate::view::entries`]. A store that
//! held only the filtered reading could not show a claim at all, and showing
//! one is the whole point of storing it. [`Everything`] is the policy the
//! claimed reading is taken under.
//!
//! WHO WROTE AN OBJECT IS A READING TOO. An event's `actor` is a field its
//! writer chose; a history can prove it (§3's signatures, [`Proof`]). A
//! policy may ask for that proof, and [`Proven`] is the one combinator that
//! does, over any policy: an object binds under it where the history proves
//! its actor AND the policy it wraps binds it. So standing is a function of
//! the object and of a reading of the history it is in, and the history's
//! only through that reading, which is a function of its object set (law
//! 41): never of the log's order or the moment.
