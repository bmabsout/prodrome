//! A schema: what a store's events are, and what each one writes
//! (`docs/design-register-types.md` §5).
//!
//! THE EVENT TYPE IS THE SCHEMA. Its values are the events the schema names,
//! a closed sum of constructors with frozen fields, so an event outside the
//! vocabulary is not a value of the type: §2's parse refuses it at the
//! boundary. The impl says the rest: the entity each event is about, the
//! registers it writes, and which events a policy is asked about.
//!
//! A schema is the STORE'S type (`EventStore<S>`), as the payload was. No
//! object carries it: a stored print is parsed against the schema the store
//! was opened at, so `Genesis(label, nonce)` stays frozen.
//!
//! [`crate::event::TodoEvent`] is the reference schema ([`crate::todo`]):
//! §4's six kinds and the record kind, and every legacy envelope is read at it.
//! A schema MAY price its entities ([`Price`]); one that does not has no
//! price at all, which is not FPL's `Absent`.

/// A store's events and what they mean.
///
/// # The contract
///
/// - [`Schema::Vocabulary`], [`Schema::to_value`] and [`Schema::from_value`]
///   are the STORED SHAPE: every constructor an event may print, with its
///   declared field order, the print in that order, and the parse that refuses
///   what a smart constructor would. None of the vocabulary's names may be an
///   envelope's (`Sealed`, `Woven`, `Genesis`, `Change`, `Snapshot`), which are
///   looked up first.
/// - The vocabulary is a VALUE, the schema as data: what a parse reads and
///   what a boundary names registers by. A Rust schema's is a unit its type
///   already says everything of (`Default`); a declared one's is the
///   declaration a host admitted at run time ([`crate::declared`]). A store
///   is opened at one, and no object carries it.
/// - [`Schema::key`], [`Schema::at`] and [`Schema::actor`] are what every
///   event says: about what, when its writer thought it was (data, never an
///   order), and who.
/// - [`Schema::Registers`] is an entity's REGISTERS, a [`Product`] of
///   semilattices: its `join` is the route from an event to the writes it
///   makes, each register a [`crate::fold::Frontier`] or an accumulating set,
///   read under its [`crate::fold::RegisterType`].
/// - [`Schema::writes`] is the route's NAMES: the registers whose frontier
///   this event joins and whose writes it therefore supersedes (§6). A register
///   that only accumulates, such as the todo's tendings, is not among them.
/// - [`Schema::asks`] is the policy's question: an event it answers `false`
///   for binds whoever wrote it (§5).
