//! one combinator over any tree whose nodes carry a content name. The
//! algebra is memoised at EVERY node, keyed by its own name and the node's,
//! so the cache takes the data's own shape: after a change, the nodes whose

//! computed, and every other subtree is one hit at its top, never entered.
//! Nothing names a level.
