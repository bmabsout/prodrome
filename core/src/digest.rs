//! Design §6.5: a digest, a summary tree over an append-only log of lines,
//! read through a view that fits a budget.
//!
//! A long log (a transcript, a journal) is too big to read whole. Its lines
//! are a set, each resting on the lines its writer had seen, and they are
//! the leaves of a tree ([`tree`]) whose shape is [`memo::balance`] over
//! their names in the crate's one causal order, so the shape is a function
//! of the set and not of when each line arrived: two replicas holding one
//! log build one tree, and a line that
//! arrives late renames one logarithmic spine. A node is named by
//! [`memo::name`] over its children and carries the [`Measure`] of the lines
//! it spans.
//!
//! An inner node may have a SUMMARY: a short text standing for its lines,
//! written elsewhere and recorded by the caller as an object of its own. A
//! summary is an observation, not a function of the lines, so this module
//! never makes or caches one; it reads only which nodes have one and how
//! long it is, `summarized(name)`, and says which could be written next
//! ([`pending`]).
//!
//! A [`View`] is a cut through the tree that tiles the whole log, recent
//! lines fine and old ones coarse, under a byte budget ([`view`]); [`zoom`]
//! opens a part of it into its children. The tree is lossless and only the
//! view is lossy. Everything here is a function of the leaves, the summaries'
//! sizes and the budget: no clock, no model, and nothing about what a line
//! says or who writes a summary.
