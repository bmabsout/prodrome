//! §7 — FPL: the term language, one evaluator.
//!
//! See ../../SPEC.md. Implemented against ../../conformance/fpl.py, and
//! ported from the reference `fpl.py` — the arithmetic ORDER is part
//! of the port, because the vectors are the reference's floats.
//!
//! `Explanation` is the term's shape carrying an annotation — the Cofree the
//! spec calls "decoration, not evaluation". Invariants live in the `mk_*`
//! smart constructors; a `Term` that exists came through one of them (or
//! through `parse_term`, which calls them).
//!
//! ABSENT IS A VALUE. A term's value is `[0, 1] ∪ {∅}`, and `∅` is `None`:
//! [`fulfillment`] answers `Option<f64>`, so an object with no claim on
//! attention — the `Absent` leaf, or anything composed only of it — cannot be
//! read as a number. `∅` is the identity of composition: it neither raises
//! nor lowers anything it is composed with.
//!
//! OPEN AND CLOSED. `Ref(todo)` names another todo's fulfillment, so a term
//! holding one is open; [`link`] binds every reference and answers a
//! [`Closed`] term, and only a closed term is evaluated, explained or sampled.
//!
//! NO JSON HERE. A term has ONE serialization and it is §2's literal print;
//! the JSON shape a browser reads is `prodrome-wasm-exports`'s `json` module,
//! built on the types below, because JSON is JavaScript's literal grammar and
//! this crate has its own.
