//! Prodrome — a temporal, content-addressed event database with
//! fulfillment-priority semantics.
//!
//! A store is a directory of plain files: one file per object, holding that
//! object's canonical print, named by the SHA-256 of those bytes. Objects name
//! their parents, so the history is a DAG; order is causal and the `at` a
//! writer stamped is data, read by the folds and never by the merge. A fold
//! turns the DAG into what is believed at an instant; a term of FPL turns a
//! todo into what it is worth as a function of time.
//!
//! The specification is `../SPEC.md` — it is the contract, and this crate is
//! the reference implementation of it. The vectors in `../conformance/` are
//! frozen evidence that an independent implementation once answered the same:
//! prints, hashes, linearisations, frontiers and verify findings exactly,
//! fulfillments to 1e-9. Types first (§1): every value is a closed algebraic
//! type, invariants live in smart constructors, and a record that exists is
//! valid.
//!
//! # Quick start

//! Layout, one module per layer of the spec:
//! - `literal`  — §2: the grammar, its printer (Python `repr` rules) and parser
//! - `schema`   — §4–§6: a store's events, their entities and registers
//! - `todo`     — the todo schema, the reference one: §4's kinds, §6's registers
//! - `payload`  — §4: the record kind's fields, as a type parameter
//! - `event`    — §4: the event kinds, envelopes, hashing (§3)
//! - `genesis`, `change`, `snapshot` — §3: a prodrome, a change, an attestation
//! - `dag`      — §3: the DAG as a value: tips, closure, linearisation, verify
//! - `store`    — §3: the files around a `Dag` (the lock, placement, quarantine),
//!   and replicas: one in memory, an overlay, `sync` and a `Decision`
//! - `memo`     — design §6.2: caches as tabulations of pure functions
//! - `nest`     — design §6.3: histories held in registers, and their join
//! - `term`     — §7: the functor `TermF`, its fixed point `Term`, normal form
//! - `fpl`      — §7: smart constructors, evaluation, explain (Cofree), link
//! - `chain`    — §7.1: the chain compiler, `After` erased against a snapshot
//! - `policy`   — §5: `Standing`, the `Policy` trait, and the reference policy
//! - `registers`— §6.6: the DAG's structure and each todo's stream, a monoid action
//! - `schedule` — a step function of time, and its algebra: what a
//!   `Piecewise`, a register's history and an observed value each are
//! - `fold`     — §6.1–6.5: the registers, and every reading a projection of them
//! - `breaks`   — §7 breakpoints and series knots
//! - `observe`  — §7: a view's precision, and when the value it shows next changes
//! - `view`     — §6.7: the entry, the composition of the folds above
//! - `reference`— the payload the vectors were taken with (feature `reference`)
