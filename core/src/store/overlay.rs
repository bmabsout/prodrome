/// THE UNION BY CONSTRUCTION. Its memory is the base's ([`Replica::held`]:
/// the same objects and the same fold, shared and not copied) with its own
/// objects admitted, which reads as the fold of the union (§1, and the
/// memory's incremental-equals-cold law). When the base has changed since,
/// the next read takes the base's memory again and admits its own objects
/// over it. Nothing is copied to read it: not the base's files, and not its
/// memory until the overlay holds an object of its own, when the memory it
/// extends is copied once per change of the base.
///
/// An overlay decides nothing: it has no lock another writer takes and
/// writes to memory, so it is never the store a coordinated decision is
/// asked of ([`super::Decision`]).
