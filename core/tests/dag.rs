//! SPEC §9 law 8 for §3, on `conformance/dag.py`: linearisations, tips,
//! parents and `verify` findings EXACTLY.
//!
//! Each vector is a store the reference built by appending, adopting another
//! replica's objects, and sometimes merging — so the DAGs have two heads,
//! merges, and triage-actor events dated behind what they rest on. Each is
//! rebuilt here by writing the object files alone, which is the honest way to
//! test a READER: nothing about the order, the tips or the findings may depend
//! on this side having been the writer. The vectors' `tips` were the heads the
//! writer's `HEAD` and `refs/` named; that the objects alone derive them is
//! SPEC §9.17, and the second test lays those files out too and says so.
