//! THE VECTOR GRAMMAR (SPEC §2): the conformance vectors, as literals.
//!
//! A vector file is ONE expression of §2's grammar — the same printer, the
//! same parser, the same float and string rules as a stored object — read
//! through the VECTOR VOCABULARY below and never through a store's. The two
//! vocabularies are disjoint and neither can widen the other: a store parses
//! against `event::EventVocabulary` (§4's kinds, §7's terms, the payload's
//! names) and refuses every name here, and a vector file parses against
//! [`VECTORS`] and refuses every name there.
//!
//! WHY. This crate's whole claim is that there is ONE reading of its data: one
//! closed grammar, one printer, one parser. Evidence for that claim written in
//! a second format was a second format to keep in step — and a JSON codec in
//! the core existed largely to serve it. So the evidence is in the crate's own
//! grammar now, read by the crate's own parser, and a vector file that does
//! not parse is a vector file that fails.
//!
//! WHAT IS A STRING AND WHAT IS A LITERAL. Every stored object, event and term
//! a vector holds stays a STRING holding its canonical print — never a nested
//! literal — because the exact bytes ARE what the vector is evidence of (§9.1).
//! Nesting them would have thrown that away and pinned this crate's parse of
//! them instead. Instants are `datetime(...)`, values are floats, and the maps
//! the JSON shapes keyed by todo id or object name become TUPLES of a named
//! constructor, because §2 has tuples and no mapping and because a pair with
//! two fields called `key` and `value` says less than [`Bound`] does.
//!
