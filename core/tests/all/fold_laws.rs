//! SPEC §9.2, §9.3, §9.6, §9.9, §9.17 b and laws 24, 25 and 27, as
//! properties over random logs and random two-replica DAGs.
//!
//! The vectors say this side agrees with the reference on the cases the
//! reference happened to generate. These say the AGREEMENT IS STRUCTURAL:
//! nothing rewrites history, order is causal and the stamp is data, the
//! conflicts are named exactly and price as their most urgent world, no
//! linearisation and no claim decides a value, and the entry (§6.7) is the
//! composition of the registers and nothing else.
//!
//! The generators mirror the reference generator's `a_log`/`an_event` — the
//! same three todos, its seven kinds in its proportions with `Tended` beside
//! them, the same two actors with one of them on the reference policy's
//! roster — so a failure here is a failure the vector generator could have
//! produced, and a fix is checkable against it.
//!
//! And §9.18 at the store: over logs whose specs are `Absent`, references to
//! todos with no function, to todos never seen and to each other, a
//! reference links to `Absent` exactly when its todo is known and has no
//! function, and every row reads what that link reads.
//!
//! The DAG laws build REAL stores in temp directories and drive them the way a
//! second replica would: append, adopt, write concurrently, merge. Nothing
//! about a frontier may depend on this side having constructed the graph in
//! memory.
