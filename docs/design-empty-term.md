# Design: the empty term, and the two layers

Status: implemented, 2026-09-28 (Unreleased). SPEC §7, §7.2 and law 18 of
§9 are the contract; this page is the reasoning.

## Why

Some objects have no claim on attention: a note, a reference, a proposal
nobody has priced. Today that is `spec: Option<Term>`, and the absence leaks
out as special cases: rows with no value, a `Ref` to an unpriced todo that
fails to link, and every reader deciding for itself where the unpriced rows
go. A term that means "no temporal value" makes FPL total, and turns those
cases into ordinary evaluation.

## The term

`Absent` is a new leaf of `TermF`. Its value is `∅` at every instant, so a
term's value becomes `[0, 1] ∪ {∅}`. `∅` is the identity of composition: it
neither raises nor lowers anything it is composed with.

| Term | With `∅` |
|---|---|
| `Absent` | `∅` |
| `Conj(terms, p)` | the power mean over the members that have a value; `∅` when none do |
| `Gate(gate, body)` | an absent gate is no gate: `⟦body⟧`; an absent body is `∅` |
| `Offset`, `Shift`, `Importance`, `OffsetBy` | `∅` in, `∅` out |
| `Within(window, p, a)` | the power mean over the samples that have a value; `∅` when none do |
| `Piecewise` | the piece in force, which may be `Absent` (priced from a date, or unpriced after one) |
| `After`, `Recur` | `pending` may be `Absent` |
| `Ref(x)` for a known todo with no spec | links to `Absent`, no longer a refusal |

`LinkError::Unknown(x)` stays for an id the store has never seen, and
`LinkError::Cycle` is unchanged.

**No stored byte moves.** `Absent` is a new constructor (§1). A record whose
`spec` is `None` reads as `Absent`, so an old store reads exactly as before,
except that a `Ref` to an unpriced todo now links. `Conj([])` keeps its
stored meaning of 0.5; only a `Conj` whose members are all absent is `∅`.

**Readers.** `entry.value` becomes a number, `absent` or a `LinkError`. A list
orders absent rows after every priced one, by id, so ordering is defined in
one place and not by each host.

**Laws** (§9, with vectors):
- `Conj(ts ++ [Absent], p) = Conj(ts, p)` whenever `ts` has a value.
- A term with no `Absent` evaluates exactly as it does today.
- `link(Ref(x))` is `Absent` exactly when `x` is known and has no spec.
- `explain` and the series carry `∅` where a node has no value, and `Absent`
  is exact, with no breakpoints.

## The two layers

With every spec `Absent`, a store is close to git's object database:
immutable objects named by their hash, a DAG of parents, union as merge, and
tips derived from the objects, which is git without refs. It differs from git
in three ways:
- it stores events, one fact about one entity, and not snapshots;
- time is data, so a fold answers "what was believed at `t`";
- a policy decides which writers bind and which only claim.

FPL, meaning terms, fulfillment and composition, is the layer on top that
turns that store into a prioritisation database. The empty term is what makes
the boundary clean: an unpriced object is simply a layer-one object.

This is a direction, not a split. The crates stay as they are, in this
repository, until the code shows a boundary worth a crate of its own.

## What it enables

A host can keep objects that are not todos in the same store, each with its
own payload type and, when it matters, its own price. Suzatary's next use is
proposals: a draft email or a changeset is an object whose id is the hash of
its content. Performing it appends its completion, carrying the response. A
second submission of the same object reads that completion and returns the
same response, so the effect runs once. Its price is usually `Ref` to the
todo it serves.
