// FROM OBJECTS TO THE DATA A PAGE TYPESETS — one pure function, run in the
// browser against the core compiled to WebAssembly.
//
// Nothing here evaluates FPL. Every number is one the core answered:
// `entries` composes the rows (SPEC §6.7), `fold` gives each todo's function
// and the environment, `link` closes a function over the others, and
// `fulfillment`, `series_knots` and `explain` read it. What this file adds is
// WHICH instants to ask about — the thirty days of the trace, fifteen back
// and fifteen ahead — and the shape `typst/lib.typ` reads. A value is a number or `∅`
// (`null`): a term with no value at an instant, never read as a number.
